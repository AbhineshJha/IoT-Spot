<br>

# Purpose
To Test this API in a build a sample app which write Mohamed Ismail then new line ahmed and number 30 
not a string its an integer number.
<br>

# Component required
Simulation environment - Proteus 8
Atmega 32
LCD screen
Wires
Power source - Laptop or battery
Potentiometer 1K
<br>

# Description
Used The made API (Driver) to configure the LCD. This Driver makes it easier to operate with the LCD since it consists for many functions like LCD_String_xy, LCD_SendNumber etc.
<br>

# Workflow
write Mohamed Ismail then new line ahmed and number 30 not a string its an integer number.
<br>

# Setup 
Connect the circuit diagram as shown in the image and press the simulation button

# Output
Output video and images is added in the Gallery folder
