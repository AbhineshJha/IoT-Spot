### Remote Control Car Circuit
## AIM:
To make a remote control car circuit on tinkercad.
## Purpose:
On giving instructions:
Forward(F) -- Car will move in forward direction.
Backward(B) -- Car will move in backward direction.
Left(L) -- Car will move in left direction.
Right(R) -- Car will ove in right direction.
Stop(S) -- Car will stop.

## Short Description:
Requirements:
* Arduino Uno R3
* 2 Motors
* Tinkercad
* L239D Motor Driver
* Breadboard
## Workflow:
* Forward(F) -- Car will move in forward direction.
* Backward(B) -- Car will move in backward direction.
* Left(L) -- Car will move in left direction.
* Right(R) -- Car will ove in right direction.
* Stop(S) -- Car will stop.
