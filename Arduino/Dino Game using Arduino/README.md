# Dino Game using Arduino

## AIM:
To create a dino game using arduino.

## Purpose:

To mimic the chrome dino game using arduino with LCD and Push buttons.

## Short Description:

**Requirements:**

- Arduino Board
- 16x2 LCD
- 1K ohm Resistor
- 2 Pushbuttons
- Some Wires
## Setup instructions:

- We connect Arduino UNO to the LCD using 4 Pins of Data and the control Pins R/W, E and RS.
- We connect LCD power pins VCC and GND to Arduino 5V and GND.
- The contrast V0 pin connected to GND.
- The Backlight LED +ve connected to 5v and the -ve connected to GND through 1K ohm Resistor.
- We use pushbuttons to control the game.
