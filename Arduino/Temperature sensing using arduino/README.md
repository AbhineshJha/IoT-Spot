# Alternate LED Blinking
## AIM:
To get the temperature using arduino

## Purpose:
To gupdate the temperature in degree celcius in every second.

## Short Description:
**Requirements:**
- Arduino UNO R3
- breadboard
- wires
- Temperature sensor [TMP36]
(Tinkercad can also be used.)

## Workflow:
- We initiate a loop
- A delay of 1 s is added.

## Setup instructions:
- Assemble the circuit as shown below.
- M35 sensor has three terminals - Vs, Vout and GND. We will connect the sensor as follows âˆ’
-- Connect the +Vs to +5v on your Arduino board.
-- Connect Vout to Analog0 or A0 on Arduino board.
-- Connect GND with GND on Arduino.
- Upload the code provided [here](https://github.com/ritikalohia/IoT-Spot/blob/main/Arduino/Temperature%20sensing%20using%20arduino/temperature.ino)
- Run to see the project in action!
