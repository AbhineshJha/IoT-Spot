# LED Control Using Potentiometer

## AIM:

To blink an LED Using Arduino

## Purpose:

LED can be make to blink at definite intervals using Arduino

## Short Description:

**Requirements:**

- Arduino UNO
- 1 LED
- Power Adapter

## Workflow:

- We initialise pinmode to the LED
- Control Blinking of an LED using delay

## Setup instructions:

- Assemble the circuit as shown below.
- Make sure to connect one end of both LED to GND
- Upload the code provided [here](https://github.com/shreya024/IoT-Spot/blob/main/Arduino/LED%20Control%20using%20Potentiometer/led_control_using_potentiometer.ino)
- Run to see the project in action!
