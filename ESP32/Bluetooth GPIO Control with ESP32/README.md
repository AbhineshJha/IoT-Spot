# How to use ESP32 Bluetooth module with Arduino IDE | Project

The ESP32 development board has an inbuilt Bluetooth module. In this post, I will show you how to use the  ESP32 Bluetooth module with Arduino IDE. And by the end of this article, you would be able to use the ESP32 Bluetooth module with Arduino IDE to control external LEDs connected to the GPIO pins.

The ESP32 board along with the inbuilt Wi-Fi module also comes with an inbuilt Bluetooth module. This makes communication with mobile devices using the ESP32 Bluetooth module with Arduino IDE quite easy and efficient.

## ESP32 Bluetooth module project details:

In this project, you will  control the external LEDs  connected to one of the GPIO pins of ESP32 using Bluetooth communication  between the ESP32 board and the smartphone.

**Note:**  I am going to use a mobile app called  _Serial Bluetooth terminal_  to control the LEDs.

## **Materials Required:**

-   ESP32 Module
-   Arduino IDE
-   Micro USB cable
-   Jumper Wire
-   1 x 100-ohm resistors
-   1 x LED
-   Bluetooth Serial Monitor App
