## **ESP32 Hall Effect Sensor Project:**

The ESP32 board has a built-in  **Hall Effect sensor**  also. This sensor is a simple piece of wire with a continuous current flowing through it.

When the magnetic field is placed around it, the charge carriers, electrons, and holes are deflected to either side. This deflection or imbalance generates a voltage difference across the sensor material. This generated voltage difference is used to measure the strength of the magnetic field.

Working of Hall effect sensor

**NOTE:**  The Arduino IDE has a  hallRead()  function that returns this voltage difference generated by the magnetic field in the form of analog value(stronger the external magnetic field, larger is the analog value returned by the function).

### **Materials Required:**

-   ESP32 Module
-   Arduino IDE
-   Micro USB cable
-   Small Magnet

**Step 1** **:**  Connect the ESP32 module to the computer through a micro-USB cable. The RED LED on the board lights up once the board is powered.

**Step 2** **:**  Go to  **Tools> Board**  from the top menu and click on the “**ESP32 Arduino”** option. Now select the ESP32 board type you are using. I have selected the  ESP32 dev module.

**Step 3** **:**  Now go to  **Tools>Port**, and select the port to which the board is connected.

**Step 4** **:** Paste/write the ESP32 hall effect program given below in Arduino IDE.

**Step 5** **:** Click the upload option to upload the code. Don’t forget to press and hold the BOOT button during the uploading process.

### **Program to use ESP32 Hall-effect Sensor:**
```c
int magnetic_value=0;
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(115200);
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  magnetic_value=hallRead();
  Serial.print("ESP32 Hall effect sensor value value: ");
  Serial.println(magnetic_value);
  delay(2000);
}
```
 

**OBJECTIVE** **:**  Print the values returned by the built-in hall effect sensor.
