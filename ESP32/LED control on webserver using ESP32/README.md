# ESP32 Web Server in Arduino IDE: Control LEDs

In this tutorial, we will learn to create a simple web server with ESP32 using Arduino IDE. This ESP32 web server controls GPIO pins or LEDs whenever it receives an HTTP GET request from a web client ( web browser). To access the web server, ESP32 should be connected with the same WiFi network to which your mobile or computer is connected.
