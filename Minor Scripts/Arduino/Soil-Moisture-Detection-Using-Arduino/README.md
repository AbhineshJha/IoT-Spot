# Aim
To detect the Soil Moisture
<br>

# Purpose
Helpful to know the changing soil moisture
<br>

# Component required
Simulation environment - Tinkercad
Arduino UNO
LCD 16 x 2 
Wires
Resistor 220 ohms 
Potentiometer 250 kilo-ohms
Temperature Sensor [TMP36]
<br>


# Workflow
We take the analog input for temperature sensor and calculate subsequent percentage using formula:100 - ( (sensor_analog/1023.00) * 100 ). Further we display the percentage in serial port for every 1s econd interval.

# Setup 
Connect the circuit diagram as shown in the image and press the simulation button then change the values for temperature sensor to know the soil moisture.
