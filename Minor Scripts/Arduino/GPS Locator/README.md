# GPS Locator using Arduino

## AIM:

Implementing a GPS Locator using Arduino.

## Purpose:

To detect the location and direction and displaying it on the LCD.

## Short Description:

**Requirements:**

- 2 Arduino UNO
- 1 NeoPixel
- 1 LCD Display
- 2 Resistors
- USB
  (Tinkercad can also be used)

## Workflow:

- First we initialise Buzzer as digital output and Force Sensor as analog input.
- We initiate a loop
- Using conditional statements we turn on the buzzer when the value of the Force Sensor exceeds threshold.

## Setup instructions:

- Assemble the circuit as shown below.
- Make sure to connect one end of both LED and switch to ground(i.e. GND)
- Upload the code provided [here](./gps_locator_using_arduino.ino)
- Run to see the project in action!
