# Speeding Motor Using Arduino


## Aim

Water Level Controller using arduino.

## Platform Used:
- TinkedCad

## Components Required

- Arduino Uno
- Jumpwires
- Breadboard
- L293D Motor Driver
- Ultrasonic Sensor
- DC Motor
- Buzzer


## Workflow of the Project

In this project, we are making water level overflow alarm. After certain amount of water, the buzzer starts making sound. The idea behind the project is that ultrasonic sensor reads the water level and according to that if water level reaches certain height, buzzer activates.

## Setup instructions

- Assemble the circuit in Tinkercad as shown in the circuit diagram.
- Upload the code provided in this [link](https://github.com/baibhav3211/IoT-Spot/blob/main/Arduino/Water%20Level%20Controller/water_level_controller1.ino).
- Run the simulation and move the ultrasonic rays as given in simualation video.
