# Aim
Node MCU wireless communication for Traffic Signal Control<br>

# Purpose
Helpful to know the working of node mcu and it's wireless connection.
<br>

# Component required
Simulation environment - Arduino IDE
Node MCU
Wires
Led (Red, Yellow, Green)
<br>


# Workflow
We have completed the setup as per the given images mentioned in the '/images/'<br>
We use the Node MCU for wireless connection purpose with the led's. We connect the Node MCU with the wifi and enter the mentioned url in the browser to see the functionality of the wireless communication of the Node MCU and led's.
